\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Overall goal:} apply Reinforcement Learning to packet route
  optimization for a class of Wireless Ad Hoc Network known as Mobilized Ad
  Hoc Networks (MANETs)
\item
  Route optimization for MANETs is difficult

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    network topology is dynamic
  \item
    generally decentralized
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Additional problem difficulties:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    transmission cost / interference
  \item
    power constraints
  \item
    scalability
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \hypertarget{wanets}{%
\section{MANETs:}\label{wanets}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  decentralized network structures
\item
  nodes are mobile:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    can move in space
  \item
    may join/leave any time
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{applications}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    mobile internet (e.g: project LOON)
  \item
    mobile phone networks / SPANs
  \item
    mobile sensor networks
  \item
    vehicular networks / VANETs
  \item

\emph{Range of communication demonstrated by surrounding circle}

    \hypertarget{communication-scheme}{%
\section{Communication Scheme:}\label{communication-scheme}}

Each device uses radio waves to communicate packets to other devices.
The broadcasted message is transmitted between nodes over a certain
frequency channel. If two devices use the channel simulatenously, a
``collision'' occurs. This nullifies both broadcasts.

\includegraphics[width=.8\maxwidth]{interference.png}

\pagebreak

This can cause complex interactions amongst the communication nodes. For
example in the \emph{``hidden node problem''} (see below), node
\(N_{A}\) can see \(N_{B}\), but cannot see \(N_{C}\). If \(N_{A}\) and
\(N_{C}\) both communicate to \(N_{B}\) simultaneously, then a collision
will occur; furthermore, node \(N_{A}\) cannot attribute this collision
to \(N_{C}\) unless information is shared amongst the nodes.

\includegraphics[width=.8\maxwidth]{hiddennode.png}

These interference problems coupled with a decentralized control scheme
can lead to inefficient routing. A large portion of time can be spent
rebroadcasting messages which previously collided.

\section{Traditional Solutions
(abridged):}\label{traditional-solutions-abridged}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Reactive routing (AODV):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This method is reactive because nodes do not save information
    regarding the entire network topology. They only maintain
    connections to local neighbors.
  \item
    Nodes periodically send ``hello'' messages to gain information about
    their immediate neighbors.
  \item
    Whenever a node wishes to send a packet through the network, it
    sends a ``route request'' (RREQ) to find a path to the destination.
    This request is passed along the network following a fixed protocol
    until the destination is found. Then the information is passed back
    through the network to the sending node.

  Proactive routing (OLSR):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This method is proactive as the nodes maintain a local ``image'' of
    the network's full topology.
  \item
    Nodes periodically send ``hello'' messages to gain information about
    their immediate neighbors.
  \item
    Additionally, nodes broadcast their local connections to the rest of
    the network through ``flooding''. Essentially, the information is
    spread to every connected node in the network by a fixed policy.
    ``Flooding'' can cause unnecessary transmission and cause packet
    collisions.
  \item
    With a local image of the network, a version of shortest path
    algorithm is applied to find a suitable path to the destination.

\section{Initial RL Formulation:}\label{initial-rl-form}}
Assume constraints from sections 6 and 7. The following is an initial attempt
at formulating the state space, action space, and learning mechanism. 

\subsection{State Space}
Let the state space be broken into two primary sections as described below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item \underline{Environment state}

Let a node's estimate of the true environment state be represented by an undirected graphical model $G(V,E)$ with vertices $V$ and edges $E$.

\includegraphics[width=.7\maxwidth]{undirected-graph.png}


Each vertex $v \in V$ represents an agent within the assumed collaborative scheme.
(Let $v_\ell$ represent the local agent).  Each edge $e(v_i,v_j) \in E$ represents
the communication channel connecting two nodes.

Each vertex $v_i \in \{V \diagup v_\ell\}$ will hold the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item
node ID
\item
flag if $v_i$ is a source or destination of a packet in buffer
\item
counter for time elapsed since $v_\ell$ directly communicated with $v_i$ last (only for neighbors)
\item
counter for time elapsed since $v_\ell$ received topology information from $v_i$
\item
information regarding collisions between $v_\ell$ and $v \in \{V \diagup v_\ell\}$
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

Each edge $e \in E$ will will hold the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item
channel quality characteristic 
\begin{itemize}
\item could be simple: number representing channel strength
\item could be complex: vector-valued characterization
\end{itemize}
\item
uncertainty metric for channel information (freshness counter)
\end{itemize}

Assuming each node can communicate over multiple frequency channels $f_1,f_2,...$
for each link $e(v_i,v_j)$, the above formulation can be extended to a vector where
each entry characterizes a sub-channel for each frequency $f_1,f_2,...$

Additionally, it may be beneficial to maintain a history of $n_\ell$'s topology
estimates as a more dynamic state space.
I.e. $\vec{G} = \{G_1(V_1,E_1),...,G_m(V_m,E_m)\}$

\medskip
\includegraphics[width=.7\maxwidth]{graph-hist.png}
\medskip

\item \underline{Local buffer state}

The buffer state of $ v_\ell$ will represent the node's local packet buffer. It is 
assumed the buffer is dynamic in that the agent may send packets without respecting
the order they were received.

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Quene.png}

Each entry in the buffer will include the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item
flag for packet presence
\item
packet source, destination
\item
time spent traveling through network
\item
time spent in buffer
\item
estimate to reach destination (if destination location is known)
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Action Space}
Similar to the state space, the action space can be divided into two sections as described below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\underline{Communication Actions}

At each discrete time instance $t$ the agent will choose among the available actions. 
These actions all utilize the same communication medium and are thus mutually 
exclusive.
 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Sense subset of neighboring nodes $S(N(n_\ell)) \in N(n_\ell)$
\item
forward prioritized packet to neighbor $n_j \in neighborhood(n_\ell)$
\item
share topology estimate $G(V,E)$ with node subset $S(V) \subseteq V$
(this would not directly scale well, but it can be pared down)
\item
WAIT/do nothing
\end{itemize}

\item
\underline{Buffer Scheduling}

Buffer scheduling will ultimately prioritize packets within the buffer for sending.
The buffer scheduler could potentially operate semi-asynchronously from the 
communication portion of the agent.  
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Time-Domain Scheduling}
In order to avoid collisions between two transmitting nodes, a time-domain scheduling 
algorithm should be utilized. Such an algorithm will attempt to 
schedule node transmissions in time to minimize the number of collisions. Even with a 
centralized controller, scheduling for ad hoc networks is NP-hard (Data Networks, Bertsekas and Gallager)

\medskip

Random access scheduling protocols for MANETs exist and could be used in order to 
simplify the scope of the problem. I am unsure of how well these scheduling 
algorithms perform; however, I plan to investigate how scheduling may benefit from 
learning algorithms. 

\subsection{Learning Method}

The state and action space for the above constructions seems very large (possibly
intractably large). I would imagine that the state and actions spaces can be pared 
down by simple assumptions (such as reducing the size of the input topology graph
by only preserving full information for a subset of the graph)

If the state and action spaces remained large, I would think that some functional 
approximation method would be advised. The envisioned RL algorithm would utilize
work on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. By preserving the graphical structure of the network toplogy, the full information quality of the data would 
be preserved. 

\includegraphics[width=.8\maxwidth]{graph-conv-net.png}

The specific formulation of the deep Q-network using graph convolutional neural 
networks is left open. Additionally, I am still considering what paradigm should
be considered for the multi-agent interaction and how the reinforcement signals
should be shared. 

The reinforcement signal itself, as stated in section 10, will be related to some
QoS metric / transmission slowdown/ or successful transmission percentage.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  nodes can ``sniff'' packets and infer the graph structure
\item
  nodes could proactively probe the network to learn its structure
  (causal graph inference)
\item
  sharing information with neighboring nodes comes at a cost

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    how can the agent's local information be shared at different sizes?
  \item
    essentially a variable-sized embedding?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  perhaps it is wise to share some information at times which are less
  busy? (offline learning)
\item
  it seems that the model complexity of each node in the network could
  be variable and dependent on its position in the network

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    less connected nodes probably are less important in the global
    optimization and thus require less information
  \item
    spend power most efficintly based on network position
  \end{itemize}
\item
  if a core model is shared amongst the agents, then it may improve
  coordination

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    each node can anticipate the actions of the others
  \item
    maybe some portion of the model is shared and another is not (role
    assignment)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  what about fairness?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    for example, in a mobile phone network the users closest to the bay
    stations will receive higher traffic loads
  \item
    perhaps these methods make more sense in settings where fairness
    isn't as relevant (team strategy vs.~mutual cooperation)
  \end{itemize}
  
\item
  perhaps some information is always passed along as part of the packet header?
  Inspiration from ant colony optimization.
  
\item
perhaps packet size can be accounted for in the scheme (some messages might be considerably smaller and require less time to transmit
