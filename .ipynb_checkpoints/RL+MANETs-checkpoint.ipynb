    "   \n",
    "This can cause complex interactions amongst the communication nodes. For example in the _\"hidden node problem\"_ (see below), node $N_{A}$ can see $N_{B}$, but cannot see $N_{C}$. If $N_{A}$ and $N_{C}$ both communicate to $N_{B}$ simultaneously, then a collision will occur; furthermore, node $N_{A}$ cannot attribute this collision to $N_{C}$ unless information is shared amongst the nodes. \n",

    "## Traditional Solutions (abridged):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reactive routing (AODV):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This method is reactive because nodes do not save information regarding the entire network topology. They only maintain connections to local neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Nodes periodically send \"hello\" messages to gain information about their immediate neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Whenever a node wishes to send a packet through the network, it sends a \"route request\" (RREQ) to find a path to the destination. This request is passed along the network following a fixed protocol until the destination is found. Then the information is passed back through the network to the sending node. \n",
    "<img src=\"photos/AODV.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Proactive routing (OLSR):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This method is proactive as the nodes maintain a local \"image\" of the network's full topology. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Nodes periodically send \"hello\" messages to gain information about their immediate neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Additionally, nodes broadcast their local connections to the rest of the network through \"flooding\". Essentially, the information is spread to every connected node in the network by a fixed policy. \"Flooding\" can cause unnecessary transmission and cause packet collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * With a local image of the network, a version of shortest path algorithm is applied to find a suitable path to the destination. "
